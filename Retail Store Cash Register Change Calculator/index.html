    <h1>
      Imagine you are developing a cash register application for a retail store.
      Your task is to write an algorithm that calculates the change to be given
      to the customer in the fewest number of bills and coins. The available
      bill denominations are $20, $10, $5, $1, and the available coin
      denominations are 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢.
