    <h1>
      You are working on an e-commerce website, and you need to implement a
      function that calculates the optimal way to give change for a purchase.
      The function should take the purchase amount and the amount paid by the
      customer as input, and it should return the change in the form of the
      least number of bills and coins. The available denominations are $50, $20,
      $10, $5, $1, 25¢, 10¢, and 5¢.
