    You are tasked with creating an algorithm for a vending machine. The vending
    machine should return the minimum number of coins as change to the user. The
    available coin denominations are 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢. For example, if a
    user inputs 63¢, the vending machine should return 2 quarters, 1 dime, and 3
    pennies.
